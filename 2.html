1
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,633
You ever feel like nothing you do matters?

2
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:07,807
You leave footprints on the
beach and somehow they are gone.

3
00:03:08,248 --> 00:03:11,450
Like its just today, over again.

4
00:03:12,051 --> 00:03:15,724
They say that your teen years are
for making friends and having fun.

5
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,556
Which made me feel even worse.

6
00:03:19,026 --> 00:03:22,970
Hey, Amy. It's Jake. I'm
in your math class.

7
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,442
- Hey do not forget your adult diapers.
- Yeah right.

8
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,719
Jake.

9
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,791
Its a phone for you.

10
00:03:37,231 --> 00:03:40,504
But that day, everything changed.

11
00:03:42,776 --> 00:03:44,577
Thanks for the ride, Shelly.

12
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:47,810
How come you have to go
deal with your grandpa?

13
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,482
My dad, couldn't get out of work

14
00:03:50,922 --> 00:03:53,555
I didn't think he worked.

15
00:03:55,266 --> 00:03:59,770
You know, I'm...
I'm just gonna call grandpa.

16
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,973
Hello, this is Abe.

17
00:04:04,373 --> 00:04:05,444
Hey, it's Jake.

18
00:04:05,744 --> 00:04:07,286
No, don't come here.

19
00:04:07,616 --> 00:04:08,847
Listen to me.

20
00:04:09,257 --> 00:04:10,688
Its not safe!

21
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,220
Stay away.

22
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,492
Grandpa, did you take
your pills today?

23
00:04:14,832 --> 00:04:16,133
The Key!

24
00:04:16,403 --> 00:04:18,565
To my gun cabinet...
it was in the drawer.

25
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:20,236
And now its gone!

26
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:23,451
Yeah, Dad took it. Alright?

27
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:25,090
For safekeeping.

28
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,551
It's okay.

29
00:04:26,822 --> 00:04:30,094
Your father wants, I should
to fight them without a gun?!

30
00:04:34,798 --> 00:04:36,670
God bless him.

31
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,142
Whats his deal? Alzheimers?

32
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,143
Dementia.

33
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,652
That guy gave me the
heebie-jeebies.

34
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,571
Holler if you need me.

35
00:05:23,087 --> 00:05:24,659
Grandpa!

36
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:50,740
Shelly!

37
00:05:55,914 --> 00:05:57,215
What's going on?

38
00:05:57,586 --> 00:05:58,917
Someone broke in!

39
00:05:59,287 --> 00:06:02,219
I have a .38 in my car, you wait there.

40
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,018
- 911, what is your emergency?
- 911? Yeah I... I need

41
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:11,346
the para-medics to 2040 Palm Circle.
My grandpa...

42
00:07:12,356 --> 00:07:16,400
- Grandpa?
- You have to get away from here.

43
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:19,162
Please, listen.

44
00:07:19,702 --> 00:07:20,942
Go to the Island...

45
00:07:20,953 --> 00:07:23,314
<i>Sir, the paramedics
are on there way.</i>

46
00:07:23,405 --> 00:07:25,978
Find Emerson...

47
00:07:26,448 --> 00:07:28,211
The postcard...

48
00:07:28,422 --> 00:07:29,819
Go to the loop...

49
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,514
September 3rd, 1943.

50
00:07:33,924 --> 00:07:36,966
Its okay, just... just don't move.
There's an ambulance coming.

51
00:07:36,997 --> 00:07:39,645
I know you think I'm crazy.

52
00:07:39,656 --> 00:07:43,382
But the bird will
explain everything.

53
00:07:44,543 --> 00:07:47,385
Will you do this Tegrisco?
Promise me?

54
00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:49,387
I promise, yes..

55
00:07:50,057 --> 00:07:52,289
I thought I could protect you.

56
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:57,964
I should have told you years ago.

57
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:07,121
Grandpa! Tell me...
tell me what?

58
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:08,723
GRANDPA!

59
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:31,561
Shelly behind you!

60
00:08:44,882 --> 00:08:48,024
There was no one there.

61
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,125
May I say Jake...

62
00:08:50,136 --> 00:08:53,149
that considering this
was only a month ago

63
00:08:53,469 --> 00:08:56,271
I think you're doing
exceptionally well.

64
00:08:56,741 --> 00:08:59,374
Apart from being crazy?

65
00:09:00,044 --> 00:09:03,187
Having nightmares and anxiety
doesn't make you crazy.

66
00:09:03,617 --> 00:09:06,059
And what about seeing
things which aren't there?

67
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:09,432
Actually in dramatic situations
its not at all uncommon.

68
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:12,252
Your subconscious mind draws
an image from a movie, or...

69
00:09:12,805 --> 00:09:14,736
It was a story.

70
00:09:16,007 --> 00:09:18,479
My grandpa told me
stories when I was a kid.

71
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,281
About monsters that
he fought in the war.

72
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,382
So there you go.

73
00:09:22,923 --> 00:09:26,696
He was brutally attacked. And in your
head the man who did it was inhuman.

74
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,067
A monster.

75
00:09:28,537 --> 00:09:30,269
It wasn't a man though.

76
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:35,043
The cops said that dogs
scratched up the screen door.

77
00:09:35,483 --> 00:09:37,885
And he chased them
off into the woods.

78
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:41,318
And the coroner said
he had a heart attack.

79
00:09:41,658 --> 00:09:43,660
And the cops said

80
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:47,703
dogs went for the soft parts.

81
00:09:49,034 --> 00:09:53,147
The DNA had wounds of animals

82
00:09:53,578 --> 00:09:56,080
so that's case closed.

83
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,693
He sounds like an
extraordinary gentleman.

84
00:10:00,293 --> 00:10:02,395
Were you very close?

85
00:10:02,795 --> 00:10:04,096
Puerto Rico.

86
00:10:04,427 --> 00:10:05,798
Here.

87
00:10:06,498 --> 00:10:09,441
There is a lake where the
water glows in the dark.

88
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:13,884
And a secret tunnel. That's
where I hid from the monsters.

89
00:10:14,385 --> 00:10:16,657
He used to babysit me a lot.

90
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:20,229
And when I was with
him I felt special.

91
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:23,732
Abe.

92
00:10:24,233 --> 00:10:27,035
Its like 11 o'clock.
What is he doing up?

93
00:10:27,806 --> 00:10:29,289
I'm going to be an explorer.

94
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,989
Grandpas told me about
my first voyage.

95
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,922
Everything has already
been discovered, buddy.

96
00:10:40,396 --> 00:10:43,015
Pay no attention to your father.
He knows bubkiss.

97
00:10:43,026 --> 00:10:45,921
Come tegrisco... off to bed.

98
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,460
Can you tell me a story.

99
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:58,891
The usual?

100
00:10:59,602 --> 00:11:01,263
Okay.

101
00:11:01,973 --> 00:11:04,976
Once upon a time there
was a little boy

102
00:11:05,346 --> 00:11:07,278
where's the pictures?

103
00:11:07,978 --> 00:11:09,079
Pictures.

104
00:11:16,225 --> 00:11:20,138
Once upon a time a
little boy called Abe.

105
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:22,000
That was you.

106
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,245
That was me and he lived

107
00:11:24,256 --> 00:11:29,096
in a lovely children's home on
an little island near Wales.

108
00:11:29,586 --> 00:11:31,958
Where the sun shone every day.

109
00:11:32,488 --> 00:11:34,990
The Headmistress,
Miss Peregrine...

110
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:37,402
Was very clever.

111
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,334
And she smoked my pipe.

112
00:11:39,704 --> 00:11:41,976
She could turn into a bird.

113
00:11:42,877 --> 00:11:45,909
It was a home for special children.

114
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,321
Like Bronwyn...

115
00:11:48,752 --> 00:11:50,593
and Victor.

116
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:54,196
They were both as
strong as ten men.

117
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:55,897
And Hugh

118
00:11:56,268 --> 00:12:00,171
Hugh had bees living inside him.

119
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:03,313
Where is Emma? She could float.

120
00:12:04,214 --> 00:12:07,387
She was lighter than air.

121
00:12:08,057 --> 00:12:11,121
She had to wear special
shoes made of lead

122
00:12:11,132 --> 00:12:13,412
to keep her from floating away.

123
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:15,563
Where is she now?

124
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:17,414
She's still on the Island, I believe.

125
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:20,885
My mom and papa sent me there,

126
00:12:20,896 --> 00:12:23,390
to live with the
special children.

127
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,023
And now Tegrisco time to sleep.

128
00:12:27,423 --> 00:12:29,054
He used to call me Tegrisco.

129
00:12:29,425 --> 00:12:31,596
Its Polish, for little tiger.

130
00:12:32,037 --> 00:12:34,024
Couldn't have picked a
less appropriate nickname,

131
00:12:34,035 --> 00:12:35,180
I was always a chicken.

132
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,772
Why your mom and
dad send you away?

133
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,886
Where we lived in Poland,
it was not safe.

134
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:45,158
There were monsters.

135
00:12:45,528 --> 00:12:47,429
What kind of monsters?

136
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,631
Huge ones.

137
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:57,448
With long arms and no eyes.
And tentacles like this.

138
00:12:59,349 --> 00:13:04,323
The dumb thing was, for years I
actually believed his stories.

139
00:13:05,564 --> 00:13:08,266
This is Millard, he's invisible.

140
00:13:14,672 --> 00:13:17,414
My teacher says they
are trick photos.

141
00:13:18,445 --> 00:13:20,516
And did you believe her?

142
00:13:21,357 --> 00:13:25,691
Dad says that you get in one of those
places that you were traveling.

143
00:13:26,301 --> 00:13:28,863
I would never lie to you, Tegrisco.

144
00:13:29,303 --> 00:13:30,875
But you did it.

145
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,947
About the home... the monsters.

146
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,050
Dad told me.

147
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,794
Your father knows very well that I
went to live in the children's home.

148
00:13:42,594 --> 00:13:45,597
He said there were
monsters in Poland.

149
00:13:46,197 --> 00:13:49,240
Just not the kind with tentacles.

150
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:53,113
He said you got sent away to Wales
because there were bad people.

151
00:13:53,513 --> 00:13:57,957
People who wanted to kill
anyone who was different

152
00:13:58,487 --> 00:14:00,759
I do not want to talk
about this anymore.

153
00:14:01,229 --> 00:14:04,062
He said children were special

154
00:14:04,662 --> 00:14:08,676
but not the way you said.

155
00:14:45,576 --> 00:14:47,377
You find something good?

156
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,319
Aw. Look at that.

157
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,081
It's awesome.

158
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,992
Take that.

159
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,525
C'mon buddy, lets roll.

160
00:14:57,165 --> 00:14:59,567
How are you so okay?

161
00:15:00,768 --> 00:15:03,510
Jake, You were a lot closer
to him than I ever was.

162
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:07,413
He was a wonderful grandpa. But not...
not such a great dad, you know?

163
00:15:10,016 --> 00:15:11,908
Never seemed to pick a
job that didn't involve

164
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:14,039
late nights and long
trips away though.

165
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:19,874
Me and Aunt Sussie I always kinda thought
he was maybe cheating on our mom.

166
00:15:22,175 --> 00:15:27,420
I am sorry, buddy. I know how much
you worshipped him but there it is.

167
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,297
Surprise!!

168
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:38,138
Happy Birthday. Cousin Jake.

169
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:40,547
Jake, its great you've to come
to spend the summer with us.

170
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,242
Wait till you see the new dogs.

171
00:15:42,582 --> 00:15:44,083
Can't wait.

172
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:55,433
Its aunt Sussie.

173
00:15:55,933 --> 00:15:58,175
Thought you might want
to open this one.

174
00:15:59,105 --> 00:16:01,207
Its from your grandpa.

175
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:05,721
Found it while I was packing up. I figured
he meant to give it to you someday.

176
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:09,593
Thanks.

<i>I hope this card finds you well.</i>

181
00:16:47,065 --> 00:16:49,797
<i>The children and I yearn
to hear your news.</i>

182
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:52,299
<i>I do hope you will
visit us again soon.</i>

183
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,340
<i>"We should so love to see you."</i>

184
00:16:54,671 --> 00:16:57,883
<i>"With admiration, Alma Peregrine."</i>

185
00:16:58,314 --> 00:17:00,055
Hmm... Only two years ago

186
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:03,058
I suppose its possible she
could still be still be alive.

187
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:04,559
Right.

188
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:06,901
And I could meet her.

189
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:10,334
Maybe even find out what it was
Grandpa wanted me to know.

190
00:17:10,674 --> 00:17:12,035
But what if she's dead?

191
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,608
Dr. Golan, we are very concerned
with Jake's state of mind right now.

192
00:17:15,948 --> 00:17:19,381
And there is no way I'm putting my
life on hold to take you to Wales.

193
00:17:19,921 --> 00:17:21,653
Dad could take me.

194
00:17:22,263 --> 00:17:25,866
And he can even look at birds...
work in his book.

195
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:28,268
It means you get a break.

196
00:17:28,739 --> 00:17:32,742
And as Dr. Golan said.
Maybe I can move on.

197
00:17:33,182 --> 00:17:34,944
Like closure.

198
00:17:35,814 --> 00:17:37,822
Having an opportunity to
see this Children's Home

199
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,868
and separate fantasy
from reality,

200
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:46,903
May be useful and at the very least a
trip like this provides a chance to

201
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:49,906
say goodbye.

202
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,388
Cairnholm: Population of 92.

203
00:17:57,399 --> 00:18:02,435
Best known for its proximity to the
final resting place of the cruise liner

204
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:06,899
Augusta which sank in 1915.

205
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,471
There is only one hotel.

206
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:10,583
That's us

207
00:18:10,613 --> 00:18:13,215
I hope there's bourbon.

208
00:18:15,987 --> 00:18:19,630
Oh wow! Jake! Check it out.
That's a peregrine falcon.

209
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:23,233
Peregrine, like the Headmistress?

210
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,834
Sure.

211
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:29,078
Hey that's probably where grandpa came with
the tale of turning into a bird thing.

212
00:18:29,548 --> 00:18:31,920
Maybe. Maybe that's really her.

213
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:37,825
"Hey Ms. Peregrine, Its me Jake
I am Abe Portman's grandson.

214
00:18:38,265 --> 00:18:41,168
Please don't crap on us".

215
00:18:42,368 --> 00:18:45,741
Oh. God, Dad I'm kidding.

216
00:19:11,622 --> 00:19:13,254
What the H... Hello?

217
00:19:14,725 --> 00:19:16,296
Hello?

218
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:23,242
Anybody home?

219
00:19:25,043 --> 00:19:28,486
<i>"Two Torpedoes hit RMS Augusta 894 lost".</i>

220
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,033
Oh Hey! Any idea where I'd find
the manager of this place?

221
00:19:37,403 --> 00:19:38,404
That's me.

222
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:41,717
Sorry to keep you. Just helping
uncle Oggie to the loo.

223
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:45,180
- I'm Kev. There's a room upstairs.
- Oh, Great.

224
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,522
I'll be back in a bit.

225
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:51,395
Kev's just getting
our suite ready.

226
00:19:51,995 --> 00:19:55,368
While we are waiting, I thought maybe
we could go check out the beach.

227
00:19:55,938 --> 00:19:57,940
I thought we'd go to
the Children's Home.

228
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,342
It the beach where
the birds nest?

229
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,623
I...I thought we could
check it out real quick

230
00:20:03,184 --> 00:20:05,216
I could go to the
home by myself.

231
00:20:05,756 --> 00:20:08,228
And you can, really
take your time.

232
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:09,590
And I enjoy it.

233
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,662
Come on. Jakey. You know
your mom would freak.

234
00:20:13,202 --> 00:20:15,304
What if we can find
someone to take me?

235
00:20:17,106 --> 00:20:18,777
Hey dudes.

236
00:20:19,648 --> 00:20:20,819
Dad! I got this

237
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:24,006
I was just wondering if any of you guys
might be interested in taking my son here,

238
00:20:24,017 --> 00:20:25,403
to the other side of the island.

239
00:20:39,954 --> 00:20:41,686
And what are your names?

240
00:20:42,156 --> 00:20:44,258
I am Worm and this
is Epsy Denty.

241
00:20:44,658 --> 00:20:45,889
Epsy Bussines.

242
00:20:46,229 --> 00:20:47,661
- I thought you changed that!
- No!

243
00:20:48,001 --> 00:20:49,302
No. You did remember?

244
00:20:49,632 --> 00:20:53,135
When Lou said Epsy Bussines made
it look like cracked trousers.

245
00:20:53,445 --> 00:20:55,925
Yeah, But she said it sounded
like a personal hygiene problem.

246
00:20:56,348 --> 00:20:58,519
Wait, Are these are
like nicknames or...

247
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,292
stage names of rappers
here in Wales.

248
00:21:01,692 --> 00:21:03,994
Come on, Worm, show
this shank how its done.

249
00:21:04,294 --> 00:21:05,595
What? Now?

250
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,767
I like to throw letters
in the churches.

251
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:09,668
My father is always
there, the very dog.

252
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:11,210
But no one can with me,

253
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,112
I will break the ice
like a burning blade.

254
00:21:15,643 --> 00:21:18,055
Yes, it is, it is good.

255
00:21:19,456 --> 00:21:21,828
Should we take the shortcut, D.
We'll get there quicker.

256
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:23,530
Take it from me.

257
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,501
What? Down here?

258
00:21:41,094 --> 00:21:42,295
Yeah.

259
00:21:51,783 --> 00:21:54,555
Is this even the way to
the Children's home?

260
00:21:55,085 --> 00:21:57,487
Right through those trees.

261
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,343
No use cryin' over
a lost shoe, boy.

262
00:22:31,955 --> 00:22:34,428
The Children's Home...
What happened to it?

263
00:22:34,828 --> 00:22:38,161
The German navy A bomb
fell right on the roof.

264
00:22:38,761 --> 00:22:41,633
September the 3rd, 1943.

265
00:22:42,134 --> 00:22:43,845
Where... where did
they go after it?

266
00:22:44,205 --> 00:22:46,207
The Headmistress
and the children?

267
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:48,779
Not one survivor.

268
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:52,022
Poor little buggers... and
they were lovely too.

269
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:56,626
Why didn't he tell us
that they all died?

270
00:22:57,196 --> 00:23:01,740
He leaves to join the army and three
months everyone he knows gets killed?

271
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:06,083
Not even grandpa can turn
that into a bedtime story.

272
00:23:06,554 --> 00:23:09,386
No wonder he was
scared at being a dad.

273
00:23:09,786 --> 00:23:12,158
Being close to anyone.

274
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:14,961
Listen.

275
00:23:15,531 --> 00:23:17,733
If you need to talk about all
this with someone, buddy.

276
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:20,975
We should call Dr. Golan.

277
00:23:29,152 --> 00:23:32,565
Do you mind if I go hang out
with those other kids today?

278
00:23:33,696 --> 00:23:34,997
They asked.

279
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:37,109
Yeah. That's awesome

280
00:25:11,646 --> 00:25:13,307
Abe?

281
00:26:02,097 --> 00:26:03,598
You're Emma.


282
00:26:04,238 --> 00:26:05,940
And the twins.

283
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,881
And Olive.

284
00:26:08,282 --> 00:26:09,913
Bromwin.

285
00:26:10,754 --> 00:26:12,355
He's Miller.

286
00:26:13,126 --> 00:26:14,427
You are dead.

287
00:26:14,727 --> 00:26:16,428
All of you. You're all dead

288
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:19,501
I mean he is... he is
invisible he's still dead.

289
00:26:19,971 --> 00:26:22,303
None of us are dead.

290
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:23,775
Oh my God. Am I dead?

291
00:26:24,945 --> 00:26:26,176
No.

292
00:26:28,478 --> 00:26:31,951
You called me Abe, in the house.
Why?

293
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:34,123
You look like him.

294
00:26:34,523 --> 00:26:35,824
Just for a moment.

295
00:26:36,234 --> 00:26:39,667
Before you started screaming, running
away and concussing yourself.

296
00:26:40,108 --> 00:26:41,609
Wait, what's happening?

297
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:45,142
We are waiting until the coast is
clear before we go into the loop.

298
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,214
You never know who
might be watching.

299
00:26:48,785 --> 00:26:51,127
Wait, before we...
before we go into what?

300
00:26:51,487 --> 00:26:54,051
Please Jake
Ms. peregrine's waiting.

301
00:26:54,062 --> 00:26:57,111
She saw on the ferry and
sent us to get you.

302
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:50,125
Where do you think you're going?

303
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:52,667
To my room.

304
00:27:54,268 --> 00:27:55,939
I'm a... I am a guest here.

305
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,582
Does this look like a hotel to you?

306
00:28:01,254 --> 00:28:03,155
Yeah... No!

307
00:28:04,086 --> 00:28:05,757
I've... I've got a key.

308
00:28:05,887 --> 00:28:08,500
Talk to the manager.
He'll tell you.

309
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,731
I'm the manager, boy.

310
00:28:11,072 --> 00:28:12,133
He's American.

311
00:28:12,473 --> 00:28:13,804
Maybe he's army?

312
00:28:14,104 --> 00:28:17,317
Bollocks! Listen to his accent.
It's terrible!

313
00:28:18,318 --> 00:28:20,079
He is a spy.

314
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,121
What?

315
00:28:22,521 --> 00:28:24,823
No, I'm not I'm a tourist

316
00:28:25,523 --> 00:28:27,950
I say, we should get
the truth out of him

317
00:28:27,961 --> 00:28:29,347
the old-fashioned way.

318
00:29:03,134 --> 00:29:05,696
Come on, quick guys.

319
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:17,456
I can't believe you're real.

320
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:18,857
You're all real.

321
00:29:19,187 --> 00:29:20,505
We've been trying to tell you.

322
00:29:20,528 --> 00:29:21,649
But I am special too.

323
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:22,800
What?

324
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,702
In the pub all of you saw it.
Right?

325
00:29:25,072 --> 00:29:28,945
Everything was flying and breaking.
And that was me.

326
00:29:29,305 --> 00:29:31,247
I was doing it with my mind.

327
00:29:31,617 --> 00:29:33,549
No, that was me

328
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,721
Miller? Yeah.

329
00:29:38,363 --> 00:29:40,024
Are you naked? Yeah.

330
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,042
A bomb drops on you in 1943.

331
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,054
It is 1943

332
00:29:52,484 --> 00:29:54,986
September the 3rd, 1943.

333
00:29:55,387 --> 00:29:57,128
The whole day, every day.

334
00:29:57,398 --> 00:29:59,060
Its our loop.

335
00:30:30,685 --> 00:30:32,987
Right on time.

336
00:30:33,658 --> 00:30:36,060
Ms. Peregrine.
Delighted to meet you.

337
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,609
I do hope I'm not going
to have the pub landlord

338
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,281
knocking on my door
with the police again?

339
00:30:40,443 --> 00:30:42,505
I've had to kill them
twice this month.

340
00:30:42,805 --> 00:30:44,377
Its been terribly inconvenient.

341
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,678
We may have broken some
things, that's all.

342
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:50,762
And Olive may have
started a tiny fire.

343
00:30:51,562 --> 00:30:54,064
But they were going
to hurt Jake.

344
00:30:57,507 --> 00:30:59,009
Look at you!

345
00:30:59,709 --> 00:31:03,582
The last time dear Abe sent me a
photograph, you were a just a tiny todd.

346
00:31:04,053 --> 00:31:05,293
Don't you stand there, come in.

347
00:31:05,654 --> 00:31:07,485
Your tea is getting cold.

348
00:31:09,287 --> 00:31:11,359
How did you know about the pub?

349
00:31:11,859 --> 00:31:14,001
Your weigh approximately
a 109 pounds, correct?

350
00:31:14,571 --> 00:31:17,133
Bronwyn and the twins returned
six minutes after you ran away.

351
00:31:17,444 --> 00:31:18,644
I think I'm missing something.

352
00:31:18,745 --> 00:31:21,377
And quite apart from the fact that the
perceived safety of the pub makes it...

353
00:31:21,418 --> 00:31:23,059
the most likely place to
which you would flee?

354
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:24,829
It would take you 18
minutes to run there.

355
00:31:24,921 --> 00:31:26,815
Emma and Miller would
have been moments behind

356
00:31:26,826 --> 00:31:29,404
with the horse and trap traveling
at around 8.2 miles per hour.

357
00:31:30,434 --> 00:31:32,525
Fact doing some sort of
Kerfuffle in the pub

358
00:31:32,536 --> 00:31:34,718
and the return journey
with your added weight.

359
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:38,180
You would arrive here
with 30 minutes past 4

360
00:31:38,681 --> 00:31:40,682
now then, do you like sugar?

361
00:31:41,883 --> 00:31:45,526
That will be enough, thank you Olive.
Nobody enjoys over boiled tea.

362
00:31:55,775 --> 00:31:58,017
Let me help you, Enoch.

363
00:31:58,317 --> 00:31:59,548
Do not bother.

364
00:31:59,948 --> 00:32:02,620
Wouldn't want you to
interrupt the tea party.

365
00:32:10,807 --> 00:32:13,139
I'm so sorry for
your loss, Jake.

366
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,542
You know, then?

367
00:32:17,783 --> 00:32:19,454
I know if Abe were alive.

368
00:32:19,784 --> 00:32:22,156
You would have told
me you were coming.

369
00:32:24,498 --> 00:32:27,130
Shall we take our tea outside?

370
00:32:31,043 --> 00:32:33,946
Before he died he
told me to find you.

371
00:32:34,316 --> 00:32:36,848
There was something
he wanted me to know.

372
00:32:37,148 --> 00:32:38,790
He said you could
explain everything.

373
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:42,663
That's absolutely true. But there
are few things I can't explain.

374
00:32:42,993 --> 00:32:46,996
We are in common
parlance - as peculiar

375
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:51,080
51 seconds late, Fiona.

376
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,711
Sorry Ms. Peregrine.

377
00:32:53,011 --> 00:32:54,613
How many carrots you
need for supper?

378
00:32:54,883 --> 00:32:56,684
Just one will do.

379
00:33:10,846 --> 00:33:14,449
As I was saying some
people are peculiar.

380
00:33:14,849 --> 00:33:17,391
Its a recessive gene carried
down through families.

381
00:33:18,022 --> 00:33:22,365
Yet, many generations can pass
without a peculiar child being born.

382
00:33:22,736 --> 00:33:26,809
And alas, peculiars have been
persecuted through the ages.

383
00:33:27,209 --> 00:33:29,741
Hence, we live in places like this.

384
00:33:30,612 --> 00:33:31,813
In Wales?

385
00:33:32,183 --> 00:33:34,161
Anywhere will do if you
pick the right day.

386
00:33:34,185 --> 00:33:37,027
That's fine now, Fiona.

387
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,343
You see. I am a type of peculiar
called an Ymbryne. That means I can...

388
00:33:44,844 --> 00:33:46,405
You can turn into a bird.

389
00:33:46,615 --> 00:33:49,648
Well I do! But that's
not very useful.

390
00:33:50,188 --> 00:33:53,150
An Ymbryne's main skill is
the manipulation of time.

391
00:33:53,491 --> 00:33:58,034
We chose a safe place, a
safe day and create a loop.

392
00:33:58,295 --> 00:33:59,636
What do you mean?

393
00:34:00,066 --> 00:34:03,209
A loop preserves
the last 24 hours.

394
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:06,681
Reset the loop and the day
is yours to live in again.

395
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:10,014
Reset it daily and you
can stay there forever.

396
00:34:10,454 --> 00:34:13,187
Entirely safe from
the outside world.

397
00:34:13,657 --> 00:34:16,459
Right on time
Bronwyn, good girl.

398
00:34:20,843 --> 00:34:25,347
And that's why we Ymbrynes are
charged with the care of the young.

399
00:34:27,749 --> 00:34:30,191
And no one ever gets older?

400
00:34:30,561 --> 00:34:32,763
Its best for everyone this way

401
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:34,764
I assure you.

402
00:34:37,707 --> 00:34:42,441
Each Ymbryne commits herself to the
creation and upkeep of a place like this.

403
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:45,813
A Home for Peculiar Children.

404
00:34:58,303 --> 00:35:00,305
You've met the twins.

405
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:07,051
This is Claire

406
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,812
Miller you've met.

407
00:35:23,014 --> 00:35:25,956
And that's Hugh.

408
00:35:28,658 --> 00:35:31,270
Stop cheating Hugh

409
00:35:31,831 --> 00:35:33,872
Miller thats a foul, again!

410
00:35:34,503 --> 00:35:35,804
No it wasn't!

411
00:35:37,315 --> 00:35:40,948
If you two cant play without squabbling,
wish you wouldn't play at all.

412
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,120
Look who our referee is.

413
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,123
Good afternoon. I'm Horace.
Delighted to meet you.

414
00:35:48,935 --> 00:35:50,536
We sorely needed some new blood here.

415
00:35:51,367 --> 00:35:53,939
Super shirt by the way.

416
00:35:54,409 --> 00:35:55,710
Thanks.

417
00:35:59,613 --> 00:36:01,955
You know Emma, of course.

418
00:36:02,726 --> 00:36:04,527
And I think thats everyone.

419
00:36:05,298 --> 00:36:07,430
Didn't Bronwyn have a brother?

420
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,132
Yes, Victor's upstairs.

421
00:36:10,772 --> 00:36:12,544
Wait, where did
Enoch and Olive go?

422
00:36:12,874 --> 00:36:13,905
Heaven knows.

423
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:16,377
Enoch's been off ever since
we went to look for Jake.

424
00:36:16,787 --> 00:36:18,388
Ms. Peregrine there's a
policemen at the door.

425
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:19,530
He says it's about the pub.

426
00:36:21,321 --> 00:36:25,434
We discuss this later, Emma.

427
00:36:25,835 --> 00:36:27,866
It wasn't their fault.

428
00:36:28,467 --> 00:36:31,509
Honestly, just they were
just trying to help.

429
00:36:40,797 --> 00:36:44,000
Thanks. You're not
as vet as I thought.

430
00:36:47,342 --> 00:36:50,305
She's not really going
to kill anyone, is she?

431
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:52,777
Not if she can talk
her way out of it.

432
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:54,618
Would you help me
with something.

433
00:36:55,089 --> 00:36:58,161
Enoch usually does it but, like I
said, he is sulking somewhere.

434
00:36:59,022 --> 00:37:00,723
Is that because of me?

435
00:37:01,164 --> 00:37:03,265
He is possessive.

436
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:08,339
So... What you need help with?

437
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,041
One of my daily chores.

438
00:37:10,451 --> 00:37:12,613
Put the baby squirrel
back in the tree.

439
00:37:12,913 --> 00:37:15,125
What baby squirrel?

440
00:37:19,659 --> 00:37:21,270
That happens every day?

441
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,302
Like clockwork.

442
00:37:24,372 --> 00:37:26,904
Now, would you mind tying
that rope around my waist?

443
00:37:28,516 --> 00:37:29,517
Uh... Yeah.

444
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,371
Right. Promise to hold on tight?

445
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:46,619
I knew we messed that up.

446
00:38:46,689 --> 00:38:49,292
Abe did too... the first time.

447
00:38:49,892 --> 00:38:52,264
This used to be his job

448
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:56,708
Emma, ​​I need to tell you something.

449
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,140
He is dead.

450
00:39:00,951 --> 00:39:04,624
I know. Ms. Peregrine guessed
and she's always right.

451
00:39:06,185 --> 00:39:07,426
It's okay

452
00:39:08,197 --> 00:39:10,959
I said goodbye to him
a long time ago.

453
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,671
Were you close?

454
00:39:14,842 --> 00:39:16,844
I thought we were.

455
00:39:17,545 --> 00:39:19,246
For a while.

456
00:39:19,716 --> 00:39:21,918
But I suppose not.

457
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,293
Can I ask, was he like you?

458
00:39:29,564 --> 00:39:32,407
He was like you. Jake.

459
00:39:34,108 --> 00:39:35,779
I need to go change for supper.

460
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,681
Will you be dining with us?

461
00:39:38,011 --> 00:39:39,382
I can't stay out late.

462
00:39:39,713 --> 00:39:41,724
Suppers at 5:30.

463
00:39:42,985 --> 00:39:45,227
Well that's pretty early.

464
00:39:45,698 --> 00:39:48,859
The fact we are not all eight years of
old's seems to have eluded Ms. Peregrine.

465
00:39:49,431 --> 00:39:53,274
You can borrow some of Abe's clothes.
His room's in the attic

466
00:40:03,932 --> 00:40:05,263
Jake.

467
00:40:05,634 --> 00:40:08,066
Come meet Enoch, properly.

468
00:40:17,854 --> 00:40:20,926
Well, you must feel pretty out of place.

469
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:24,929
Don't worry. I am used to it.

470
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:28,042
I wasn't worried. Some
advice for you though.

471
00:40:28,502 --> 00:40:29,944
Man to man.

472
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,776
If you think you're staying
just because you like Emma,

473
00:40:33,116 --> 00:40:34,247
Don't bother.

474
00:40:34,647 --> 00:40:38,320
You see she swore off romance years
ago when she got her heart broken.

475
00:40:38,791 --> 00:40:41,333
And she's never gonna
change her mind.

476
00:40:44,565 --> 00:40:47,037
Enoch, I wasn't...

477
00:40:48,178 --> 00:40:50,240
What are you doing?

478
00:41:19,834 --> 00:41:21,536
Isn't he amazing?

479
00:41:21,906 --> 00:41:23,467
What did you do?

480
00:41:23,877 --> 00:41:25,239
This?

481
00:41:25,809 --> 00:41:27,951
Jake. This is not even the fun part.

482
00:41:28,351 --> 00:41:30,513
Do you want to see the fun part?

483
00:41:54,062 --> 00:41:55,864
They are like puppets.

484
00:41:56,904 --> 00:41:59,907
Just do anything I tell them.

485
00:42:00,808 --> 00:42:02,379
It is even more fun with people.

486
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:05,109
You should have seen some of the
epic battles I used to have.

487
00:42:05,111 --> 00:42:07,684
At my parent's funeral parlour.

488
00:42:09,885 --> 00:42:13,098
You need a necktie.

489
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:23,346
So. What did my grandpa
do when he was traveling?

490
00:42:23,886 --> 00:42:25,718
Visited other loops.

491
00:42:26,148 --> 00:42:27,489
Really?

492
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,221
To do what?

493
00:42:29,761 --> 00:42:32,964
Jake, there are some questions
I can't answer, alright?

494
00:42:33,564 --> 00:42:38,308
So it will be a lot easier for me
if you just stopped asking them.

495
00:42:57,143 --> 00:42:58,715
Hey, what are you doing?

496
00:42:59,315 --> 00:43:01,347
Miller, go and put
some clothes on.

497
00:43:01,947 --> 00:43:04,189
Polite persons do not
take the sup in the nude!

498
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,421
Alright!

499
00:43:08,963 --> 00:43:11,605
You can sit here Jake.

500
00:43:13,267 --> 00:43:16,079
Look at Enoch. He's jealous.

501
00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:18,311
Why would I be jealous?

502
00:43:18,781 --> 00:43:20,553
All of you can go marry
Jake for all I care.

503
00:43:20,983 --> 00:43:23,293
Do not be mean, Enoch.
She doesn't want to.

504
00:43:23,304 --> 00:43:25,036
She's just excited
to have a visitor.

505
00:43:25,457 --> 00:43:27,158
Nobody is marrying anybody.

506
00:43:27,568 --> 00:43:30,871
Now eat up your food
before it gets cold.

507
00:43:33,773 --> 00:43:35,315
Hugh.

508
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:38,347
Where's your net?

509
00:43:51,308 --> 00:43:53,139
It must be very
strange for you Jake.

510
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,611
To meet your
grandfather's friends.

511
00:43:56,081 --> 00:43:57,553
Visiting another century.

512
00:43:57,953 --> 00:43:59,554
There spaceships in
your time, Jake.

513
00:43:59,684 --> 00:44:01,126
Like the Flash Gordon books?

514
00:44:01,596 --> 00:44:04,628
Now! Now! Olive, what did I
say about the questions.

515
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:06,500
We don't discuss the future here.

516
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:09,873
We enjoy living in
the here and now

517
00:44:12,115 --> 00:44:14,276
Claire, why aren't you eating?

518
00:44:14,687 --> 00:44:16,448
She's embarrassed
in front of Jake.

519
00:44:16,748 --> 00:44:19,320
Don't be, please.

520
00:44:36,324 --> 00:44:38,426
So, Jake, what is your peculiarity?

521
00:44:39,157 --> 00:44:41,468
Oh, I'm... I'm not peculiar.

522
00:44:41,999 --> 00:44:44,401
And that my friends is why
he'll not be staying with us.

523
00:44:44,841 --> 00:44:47,143
No matter how hard we
try to persuade him.

524
00:44:47,513 --> 00:44:49,945
We've spoken about this,
Jake is just visiting.

525
00:44:50,316 --> 00:44:53,018
Do you not want to stay, Jake?

526
00:44:53,388 --> 00:44:54,719
Tonight or ..

527
00:44:55,019 --> 00:44:57,061
Forever. You should stay forever.

528
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:59,763
Why would he if he doesn't have to?

529
00:45:00,094 --> 00:45:03,606
He can live out there. Grow older
and have a good time instead.

530
00:45:04,007 --> 00:45:06,639
And leave. Just like his grandfather did.

531
00:45:11,523 --> 00:45:12,654
Emma!

532
00:45:12,954 --> 00:45:14,996
Excuse me, where she's going?

533
00:45:15,356 --> 00:45:16,697
That wasn't nice, Enoch!

534
00:45:16,997 --> 00:45:18,799
You know perfectly
well why Abe left us.

535
00:45:19,129 --> 00:45:20,330
To join the army.

536
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,319
And then he met a lady.
And had a nice wedding cake.

537
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:24,614
And a lovely little baby.

538
00:45:25,074 --> 00:45:26,875
Children!

539
00:45:27,886 --> 00:45:29,988
I know you'd all like a new friend.

540
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:33,221
But I'm sure Jake has plenty
of his own back in Florida.

541
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:40,336
I think you should all get ready for
movie-time while I answer that.

542
00:45:40,977 --> 00:45:43,779
But you always let us stay for it.

543
00:46:01,644 --> 00:46:03,916
Hi. This is Abe.

544
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,818
How is everyone?

545
00:46:12,693 --> 00:46:14,394
Yours has extra marshmallows, Jake.

546
00:46:14,865 --> 00:46:16,936
Miller, put some pajamas on.

547
00:46:17,206 --> 00:46:18,538
It is very hot in here.

548
00:46:18,878 --> 00:46:21,340
Stop moaning. Excuse me.

549
00:46:29,797 --> 00:46:31,728
My grandpa told me about this.

550
00:46:32,269 --> 00:46:34,130
Horace projects his dreams, right?

551
00:46:34,571 --> 00:46:36,242
He used to listen to the radio.

552
00:46:36,802 --> 00:46:39,314
Gets tedious when you know
every word off by heart.

553
00:46:42,487 --> 00:46:44,489
Splendid, I'll take it.

554
00:46:44,919 --> 00:46:46,590
It sounds about clothes mostly.

555
00:46:46,921 --> 00:46:48,632
Delighted to meet you.

556
00:46:49,233 --> 00:46:51,434
Super shirt by the way.

557
00:46:53,666 --> 00:46:55,738
When did he dream this?

558
00:46:56,008 --> 00:46:57,209
Last night.

559
00:46:57,549 --> 00:46:59,311
Some of his dreams are prophetic.

560
00:46:59,681 --> 00:47:02,323
But mostly they are about clothes.

561
00:47:02,683 --> 00:47:06,256
Prophetic as in, he can
see into the future?

562
00:47:20,148 --> 00:47:23,921
The Ymbryne. Who is she?
Mrs. Peregrine, you know her?

563
00:47:24,391 --> 00:47:27,464
Don't be silly. Horace was just
having a bad dream. Thats all.

564
00:48:01,662 --> 00:48:04,394
Thats quite enough.
Thank you Horace.

565
00:48:04,934 --> 00:48:06,806
I think probably get going.

566
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:11,409
You could stay the night. If you wanted to.
Rather than walk home in the dark.

567
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,612
But the island is very safe, isn't it?

568
00:48:14,982 --> 00:48:16,283
Of course

569
00:48:16,854 --> 00:48:19,174
I only meant the path is dreadfully bumpy.
Jake could trip.

570
00:48:19,626 --> 00:48:22,537
Perhaps you could show
him the shortcuts?

571
00:48:22,548 --> 00:48:25,251
Should he ever need to avoid...
bumps.

572
00:48:25,741 --> 00:48:29,314
Wont you stay to see the restart.
It is really quite spectacular.

573
00:51:12,877 --> 00:51:14,038
What was that?

574
00:51:14,449 --> 00:51:16,050
It was my phone.

575
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:19,032
It's been dead the whole time
in the loop I guess now...

576
00:51:19,323 --> 00:51:20,924
Your phone?

577
00:51:21,294 --> 00:51:25,998
Yeah, I don't like it, a telephone?
You can call people...

578
00:51:26,428 --> 00:51:29,841
And send written messages.

579
00:51:30,642 --> 00:51:32,562
Right. You'll love this.
You can take a picture.

580
00:51:32,814 --> 00:51:34,985
Press that... there... yeah.

581
00:51:35,746 --> 00:51:37,347
See?

582
00:51:44,303 --> 00:51:46,304
Whats wrong?

583
00:51:49,107 --> 00:51:53,981
Its just funny to think that one
day you'll grow up like Abe did.

584
00:51:54,381 --> 00:51:56,553
Get married... have children.

585
00:51:56,983 --> 00:51:58,655
Grandchildren.

586
00:51:59,055 --> 00:52:02,097
You might even show
them this photograph.

587
00:52:02,528 --> 00:52:05,170
And I'll still be here.

588
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:07,902
Wha... can you leave some day?

589
00:52:08,372 --> 00:52:10,674
And live in the present
if you wanted to?

590
00:52:10,985 --> 00:52:16,619
No. More than a few minutes in your
time and the years would catch up.

591
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:19,331
You'd age?

592
00:52:19,862 --> 00:52:21,133
Would... you're...

593
00:52:27,038 --> 00:52:29,279
I think it is the Ymbryne
from Horace's dream.

594
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:32,352
Are you sure it's not just a bird?

595
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:34,502
I mean, I don't know...
wouldn't it change?

596
00:52:34,794 --> 00:52:37,496
She can't. Not if she's hurt.

597
00:52:37,826 --> 00:52:41,299
I need to take her inside.
You should go.

598
00:52:43,401 --> 00:52:46,944
Please do not say anything else.
I hate goodbyes

599
00:52:49,546 --> 00:52:51,648
I'll come back tomorrow.

600
00:52:51,958 --> 00:52:55,631
There's no hurry.
I'll be here forever.

601
00:53:02,807 --> 00:53:03,938
Hey.

602
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:08,081
Have I been all this damn
island Where the hell were you?

603
00:53:08,582 --> 00:53:10,553
I was just on my way back.

604
00:53:10,923 --> 00:53:12,955
Sorry, I lost track of time.

605
00:53:13,095 --> 00:53:14,827
I was having a blast with Worm...

606
00:53:15,367 --> 00:53:16,568
and Dirty D?

607
00:53:16,868 --> 00:53:18,600
Dirty D?

608
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,502
You know what? This is...
this is good.

609
00:53:21,812 --> 00:53:25,045
This is healthy. This is
you're making real friends.

610
00:53:25,645 --> 00:53:27,787
Doing teenage stuff.

611
00:53:28,117 --> 00:53:30,597
I think this is normal. I am sure
that Dr. Golan will approve.

612
00:53:30,619 --> 00:53:31,931
Hey, you American.

613
00:53:32,231 --> 00:53:33,992
Get over here.

614
00:53:35,403 --> 00:53:39,577
Hey look here there they are,
there's D-bag and worm-man.

615
00:53:39,937 --> 00:53:41,608
Did you do this?

616
00:53:42,109 --> 00:53:44,681
What? No!

617
00:53:45,281 --> 00:53:46,622
Of course not.

618
00:53:46,983 --> 00:53:48,454
It wasn't us.

619
00:53:49,054 --> 00:53:51,854
Listen Sir, I don't know what happened
here but my son and his friends.

620
00:53:52,027 --> 00:53:55,470
Have been together all day. And Jake
would never do anything like this.

621
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:57,571
Bollocks! We haven't seen him!

622
00:53:57,872 --> 00:54:01,375
You paid us yesterday. Why would we
hang out with him today for free?

623
00:54:03,246 --> 00:54:06,118
Jake were you with them or not?

624
00:54:07,459 --> 00:54:10,192
No! I'm sorry!

625
00:54:10,902 --> 00:54:13,805
And you don't seriously
think I could do this?

626
00:54:14,305 --> 00:54:16,807
I think we're done here, sir.

627
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:19,379
Well, can pass on a message for me?

628
00:54:19,850 --> 00:54:23,853
Can you tell Dr. Golan that if she
hadn't encouraged this cockamamie trip

629
00:54:24,153 --> 00:54:27,359
maybe my son wouldn't be mopping
around all day in a derelict house

630
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:28,978
HAVING A GODDAMN BREAKDOWN!

631
00:54:30,098 --> 00:54:31,099
Hello?

632
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:33,471
Dad, I'm not.

633
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:34,902
I'm fine.

634
00:54:35,342 --> 00:54:37,074
You're not.

635
00:54:37,544 --> 00:54:39,946
You are not fine. Jake.

636
00:54:40,546 --> 00:54:43,719
Coming here was a terrible...
terrible idea.

637
00:54:44,059 --> 00:54:45,631
I'm sorry, I lied ..

638
00:54:46,531 --> 00:54:48,803
Set your alarm for 8:00 am.

639
00:54:49,404 --> 00:54:51,065
I want to get to the beach early.

640
00:54:51,405 --> 00:54:55,479
The rest of the time left on this
crap-O-island, we're sticking together.

641
00:54:56,249 --> 00:54:57,610
Where are you going?

642
00:54:57,951 --> 00:55:00,022
Downstairs for a drink.

643
00:55:48,372 --> 00:55:51,514
<i>Dearest Peregrine:
I don't wish to alarm you...</i>

644
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:54,817
<i>but one of my informants sent me this.</i>

645
00:55:55,357 --> 00:56:00,031
<i>It would appear that some of Mr. Barron's
group were in Black Pool, England.</i>

646
00:56:00,832 --> 00:56:05,035
<i>"If I recall, Ms. Avocet has a loop there."</i>

647
00:56:05,576 --> 00:56:09,449
<i>"Please warn her and suggest that
she make a new one right away."</i>

648
00:56:09,809 --> 00:56:11,010
<i>"Well hidden."</i>

649
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:18,426
<i>And take the greatest care yourself.
With Love, Abe. January 2016.</i>

650
00:56:36,091 --> 00:56:39,163
Who is ready to hit the beach?

651
00:56:44,307 --> 00:56:46,479
Oh my goodness.

652
00:56:47,009 --> 00:56:48,551
Unbelievable!

653
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:51,383
I'm right in the middle
of a nesting are?

654
00:56:51,823 --> 00:56:53,955
What kind of idiot does that?

655
00:56:55,096 --> 00:56:58,429
Actually, the main nesting
area is over there.

656
00:56:58,899 --> 00:57:00,300
I can show you, if you like.

657
00:57:00,641 --> 00:57:02,882
It's marvelous to meet
a fellow bird-spotter!

658
00:57:03,113 --> 00:57:04,674
John Lamont. Franklyn Portman.

659
00:57:05,044 --> 00:57:06,345
This is my son, Jake.

660
00:57:06,685 --> 00:57:08,217
John Newmont.

661
00:57:08,557 --> 00:57:10,388
That's a hell of a camera you got there.

662
00:57:10,819 --> 00:57:13,061
Oh, thank you, is absolutely fantastic.

663
00:57:13,531 --> 00:57:15,973
I am here to do some snaps
for a book I'm writing.

664
00:57:16,303 --> 00:57:19,906
So, you gentlemen are
here on holiday?

665
00:57:29,854 --> 00:57:32,126
So, you are not coming
to the beach today?

666
00:57:32,466 --> 00:57:33,727
What's the point?

667
00:57:34,098 --> 00:57:37,272
That guys gonna cover ******
on some big glossy book,

668
00:57:37,283 --> 00:57:39,222
no ones even wanna look at mine.

669
00:57:40,243 --> 00:57:43,015
I might just have a nice afternoon nap.

670
00:57:43,646 --> 00:57:46,468
I don't suppose you saw uncle Oggie
on you travels this morning, did you?

671
00:57:46,518 --> 00:57:48,490
He's usually here by now.

672
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:50,131
I could go look for him.

673
00:57:50,431 --> 00:57:52,563
You're not going anywhere

674
00:58:27,491 --> 00:58:30,964
Jake, you're back! Come and play!

675
00:58:34,307 --> 00:58:36,479
I need to see to Ms. Peregrine first.

676
00:58:36,849 --> 00:58:38,720
Do you know where she is?

677
00:58:43,124 --> 00:58:45,926
Jake, you're back.
How wonderful!

678
00:58:46,467 --> 00:58:48,028
How's it doing?

679
00:58:48,538 --> 00:58:50,300
Emma said it was an Ymbryne.

680
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:53,813
She, not 'it'. Ymbrynes
are always female.

681
00:58:54,173 --> 00:58:56,885
And Emma was quite correct.
This is Ms. Avocet.

682
00:58:57,316 --> 00:59:00,418
Her loop is in Black Pool England.

683
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:04,962
That was a private letter, Jake.

684
00:59:07,504 --> 00:59:10,136
Who is Mr Barron?

685
00:59:11,307 --> 00:59:15,210
Ms. Peregrine, if my grandpa was
involved with dangerous people

686
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:17,922
I need to tell the police.

687
00:59:18,293 --> 00:59:20,054
To the police?

688
00:59:20,555 --> 00:59:23,397
Are you implying Abe
died an unnatural death?

689
00:59:23,767 --> 00:59:26,700
I found him in the woods
with eyes missing.

690
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:30,643
I'd say that was pretty unnatural.

691
00:59:34,045 --> 00:59:37,218
Unless essential. I don't
discuss unpleasant matters.

692
00:59:37,688 --> 00:59:40,461
An Ymbryne's is a duty to
protect children, Jake.

693
00:59:41,061 --> 00:59:43,133
I am not a child.

694
00:59:43,803 --> 00:59:46,506
He wanted you to tell me everything.

695
00:59:50,779 --> 00:59:53,421
Oh. How frustrating for you.

696
00:59:53,982 --> 00:59:57,425
Between Ms. Peregrine rules and
my ******* not to scare you off.

697
00:59:57,925 --> 01:00:00,027
It's like no ones telling you anything?!

698
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,769
So why don't you then?

699
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,941
It's not like you want me here.

700
01:00:05,241 --> 01:00:06,372
Enoch, you can't.

701
01:00:06,642 --> 01:00:08,213
You promised.

702
01:00:08,544 --> 01:00:09,985
Olive is right.

703
01:00:10,385 --> 01:00:13,358
However, I know someone
who can break the rules.

704
01:00:13,758 --> 01:00:16,060
Want to meet him?

705
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:18,862
Enoch, do not do this! Please.

706
01:00:19,402 --> 01:00:22,835
You didn't want us to spend time together.
That's what you said.

707
01:00:24,847 --> 01:00:27,149
Well, here we all are.

708
01:00:27,609 --> 01:00:29,421
Move, Olive.

709
01:00:29,821 --> 01:00:33,494
If you're going to be like then I
do not want to be your friend.

710
01:00:35,826 --> 01:00:39,869
Enoch! Leave Victor alone.
It really upsets Bromwyn.

711
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:43,472
Stop fussing, Fiona. Don't you
think Jake should meet everybody?

712
01:00:43,772 --> 01:00:45,390
He's trying to frighten
you away, Jake.

713
01:00:45,414 --> 01:00:47,816
He was always jealous of Abe
and now he's jealous of you.

714
01:00:47,986 --> 01:00:50,758
Come and play with us instead

715
01:00:54,161 --> 01:00:57,203
I'd quite like to meet Victor.

716
01:01:02,908 --> 01:01:04,849
After You.

717
01:01:12,966 --> 01:01:14,627
Hello Victor.

718
01:01:15,098 --> 01:01:19,041
I'm Jake. I'm sorry to disturb...

719
01:01:22,083 --> 01:01:23,585
He can't hear you.

720
01:01:48,765 --> 01:01:53,339
Hello Jake, I'm Victor. Do you
want to know what killed me?

721
01:02:00,215 --> 01:02:02,161
Ah, there you are.
Is he not with you?

722
01:02:02,172 --> 01:02:03,968
Its time for our daily walk.

723
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:11,232
Emma, Who killed Victor? Was it
the people with the white eyes?

724
01:02:11,234 --> 01:02:15,337
I asked you not to ask questions.
I saw one the night my grandpa died.

725
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,641
If it really was one, you
have to tell Ms. Peregrinee.

726
01:02:21,652 --> 01:02:24,253
Could you recognize you recognize
him from a photograph?

727
01:02:24,254 --> 01:02:25,457
Do you have one?

728
01:02:25,468 --> 01:02:28,856
Then come on.
There's somewhere I go to be alone.

729
01:02:28,867 --> 01:02:30,289
I have things there.

730
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:11,272
- Is this the place?
- No. This is how we get there.

731
01:03:30,978 --> 01:03:34,551
Emma! Your shoes! Lead shoes!

732
01:05:36,441 --> 01:05:41,545
- Welcome to my secret hideout.
- How? How did you...

733
01:05:42,215 --> 01:05:47,930
Air. My peculiarity.
It does what I want

734
01:06:07,266 --> 01:06:12,510
Jake. Before your grandfather retired,
he asked me to keep this safe.

735
01:06:30,174 --> 01:06:34,108
This is my grandpa's old map.
It shows you where the loops are.

736
01:06:44,526 --> 01:06:48,663
That's him, thats the man I saw.
Who is he?

737
01:06:48,674 --> 01:06:51,682
Thats Barron. He is the Leader.

738
01:06:53,043 --> 01:06:57,136
Leader of what?
Who are these people?

739
01:06:57,147 --> 01:07:00,269
Bad people... bad peculiars.

740
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:04,185
Abe dedicated his life
to hunting them down.

741
01:07:04,196 --> 01:07:06,284
These are the ones
he never found.

742
01:07:07,034 --> 01:07:09,647
What do you mean "hunting"?

743
01:07:11,918 --> 01:07:17,366
They raided homes. Whole homes
full of children left for dead.

744
01:07:17,377 --> 01:07:18,923
Abe took lives...

745
01:07:18,924 --> 01:07:19,974
To save life's.

746
01:07:19,985 --> 01:07:23,278
He only retired when you
were born to protect you.

747
01:07:23,768 --> 01:07:25,368
From what?

748
01:07:26,979 --> 01:07:31,978
If I tell you the rest, you have
to promise not to run away.

749
01:07:33,756 --> 01:07:35,876
Jake, you belong here.

750
01:07:35,887 --> 01:07:40,383
You know that I don't.
I'm not like you.

751
01:07:40,394 --> 01:07:42,466
I'm just ordinary.

752
01:07:42,473 --> 01:07:43,952
No, but you're not.

753
01:07:43,963 --> 01:07:48,018
Jake, only a peculiar can
enter a time loop.

754
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:52,883
No, that can't be right.

755
01:07:52,894 --> 01:07:54,970
I mean... I would know.

756
01:07:54,981 --> 01:07:56,039
Fine.

757
01:07:56,950 --> 01:07:59,980
Then I'll show you
something else.

758
01:08:07,784 --> 01:08:09,115
Hurry! You'll miss it.

759
01:08:22,706 --> 01:08:25,406
Ymbrynes usually pick the
perfect date to create a loop.

760
01:08:25,417 --> 01:08:28,632
But Ms. Peregrinee ..
had to make this one in a rush.

761
01:08:29,743 --> 01:08:30,791
Why?

762
01:08:30,793 --> 01:08:34,240
Because the Germans were about
to drop a bomb on the house.

763
01:08:34,251 --> 01:08:36,596
The point is, September
the 3rd, 1943...

764
01:08:36,597 --> 01:08:38,082
wasn't perfect.

765
01:08:38,093 --> 01:08:42,052
The thing that killed
Victor came back.

766
01:09:08,794 --> 01:09:11,696
- Wait, watch out!
- Shhh, all bets are off.

767
01:09:40,049 --> 01:09:42,088
You can see it, can't you?

768
01:09:42,099 --> 01:09:43,370
No one else can.

769
01:09:43,381 --> 01:09:48,069
Its invisible, Jake. That was
Abe's greatest gift of all.

770
01:09:51,398 --> 01:09:53,810
He could see the monsters.

771
01:09:58,214 --> 01:10:02,726
We call them 'Hollowgasts'.
Hollows. For short.

772
01:10:02,728 --> 01:10:06,934
My grandpa told me about people,
who turn into monsters.

773
01:10:06,945 --> 01:10:08,631
Is that what they are?

774
01:10:08,632 --> 01:10:10,370
I will explain everything, Jake.

775
01:10:10,381 --> 01:10:12,439
I fear its my duty
now considering...

776
01:10:12,450 --> 01:10:14,606
but you should know
that in doing so...

777
01:10:14,607 --> 01:10:16,742
I'm breaking a solemn promise.

778
01:10:16,753 --> 01:10:19,924
I knew you were peculiar
when you were born

779
01:10:19,935 --> 01:10:21,653
but your grandfather...

780
01:10:21,663 --> 01:10:23,393
forbid me to tell you anything.

781
01:10:23,404 --> 01:10:26,796
His dearest wish was for you
to have an ordinary childhood.

782
01:10:26,797 --> 01:10:28,622
Well I definitely had that.

783
01:10:28,633 --> 01:10:32,340
He intended to tell you the
truth when you turned 18.

784
01:10:32,342 --> 01:10:37,732
He hoped his bed-time
stories would pave the way.

785
01:10:37,743 --> 01:10:39,467
Here's my book.

786
01:10:51,577 --> 01:10:53,243
Many years ago,

787
01:10:53,254 --> 01:10:56,853
a splinter faction emerged
among our people.

788
01:10:56,863 --> 01:10:59,752
Disaffected peculiars
tired of living in loops.

789
01:10:59,763 --> 01:11:02,105
That's Mr. Barron.

790
01:11:02,396 --> 01:11:06,334
He believed that by harnessing the
essence of an Ymbryne's powers,

791
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:07,509
he and his cronies.

792
01:11:07,510 --> 01:11:12,278
Could gain immortality and be
able to live outside loops.

793
01:11:12,289 --> 01:11:14,426
He devised an experiment.

794
01:11:17,088 --> 01:11:18,485
He kidnapped an Ymbryne

795
01:11:18,496 --> 01:11:22,443
not knowing or caring whether she
would survive the experiment.

796
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:47,943
But the fate of Barron and his
group was more horrifying still.

797
01:12:24,413 --> 01:12:27,015
Why didn't Barron turn into one?

798
01:12:39,846 --> 01:12:46,951
He did. But years later he found a way to
reverse the effects... to regain humanity.

799
01:12:47,292 --> 01:12:51,282
They had become not immortal
gods - but Hollows.

800
01:12:51,295 --> 01:12:55,298
Invisible beasts, dangerous,
cold-blooded, deadly!

801
01:12:55,608 --> 01:12:59,942
Remember I told you they raided loops?
This is why.

802
01:13:00,282 --> 01:13:04,218
Barron discovered that by consuming
the eyes of other peculiars...

803
01:13:04,229 --> 01:13:05,838
especially children,

804
01:13:14,073 --> 01:13:16,005
He began to change.

805
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:37,242
Consume enough, and a hollow can
fully regain its human form.

806
01:13:39,354 --> 01:13:41,816
Just as Barron and some
of his friends did.

807
01:13:50,973 --> 01:13:54,351
The rest of them are
stuck as Hollows.

808
01:13:54,362 --> 01:13:58,248
Are you saying that
Barron ate my uncle's...

809
01:13:58,249 --> 01:14:00,486
He needs no more eyes himself,

810
01:14:00,497 --> 01:14:04,374
but I fear he led a Hollow
to your grandfather, yes.

811
01:14:06,166 --> 01:14:08,201
After the first
attacks on Loops,

812
01:14:08,212 --> 01:14:11,971
we all got better at hiding
...making new loops... keeping our.

813
01:14:11,981 --> 01:14:13,122
Whereabouts secret.

814
01:14:13,133 --> 01:14:16,220
The Hollows grew more
desperate every year

815
01:14:16,231 --> 01:14:19,084
and Barron wishes to
help his friends.

816
01:14:19,085 --> 01:14:23,229
Miss Peregrine! Come quickly!
Miss Avocet's awake.

817
01:14:30,045 --> 01:14:32,400
Oh Miss Peregrine! They
found my new loop.

818
01:14:32,411 --> 01:14:36,289
The children... I tried to save them
but there were so many Hollows...

819
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:43,096
- I don't know how I escaped.
- You are safe now.

820
01:14:43,266 --> 01:14:44,589
None of us are safe.

821
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,979
They set up the
machine in my loop.

822
01:14:47,139 --> 01:14:49,434
They put in in the cellar
at Blackboat tower.

823
01:14:49,445 --> 01:14:51,442
- They're still there...
- The machine?

824
01:14:51,443 --> 01:14:54,679
The experiment.
They intend to do it again!

825
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:57,326
This time, he's using
more Ymbrynes.

826
01:14:57,328 --> 01:14:59,699
He still wants to be immortal.

827
01:15:02,972 --> 01:15:05,337
Do Hollows only
attack peculiars?

828
01:15:05,348 --> 01:15:08,061
Of course not! They're
monsters, Jake,

829
01:15:08,072 --> 01:15:10,992
they'll slaughter
anything in their path.

830
01:15:11,379 --> 01:15:13,913
Well, some sheep on the
island were killed,

831
01:15:13,924 --> 01:15:16,573
You don't think they're
here already, do you?

832
01:15:16,893 --> 01:15:20,693
Have you seen anyone
with white eyes?

833
01:15:22,604 --> 01:15:25,403
I'm sorry children,
we can't remain here.

834
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:26,541
What?

835
01:15:26,552 --> 01:15:29,043
We leave on the first ferry,
off the island tomorrow.

836
01:15:29,053 --> 01:15:30,458
Pack anything of importance.

837
01:15:30,469 --> 01:15:32,616
I'll make sandwiches
and lead you to bed.

838
01:15:32,626 --> 01:15:35,327
Are we leaving for good?
When are we coming back?

839
01:15:35,329 --> 01:15:38,160
Never. If Ms. Peregrine's not here
to reset the loop tomorrow night...

840
01:15:38,161 --> 01:15:41,072
- the house gets bombed.
- What? Our house?

841
01:15:41,073 --> 01:15:44,194
Don't cry, Miss Peregrine will find you
another lovely house... somewhere else.

842
01:15:52,092 --> 01:15:56,125
Once this loop closes, that's it!
I can't get back to my own time.

843
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:58,737
You didn't seem
very happy there.

844
01:15:58,748 --> 01:16:01,569
I can't just leave!
I have a family.

845
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:05,612
And you felt ordinary. Like
nothing you do changes anything.

846
01:16:05,613 --> 01:16:09,576
And, now you have a chance to do
something that changes everything.

847
01:16:09,587 --> 01:16:11,587
Jake, were in danger...

848
01:16:11,588 --> 01:16:15,027
and you're the only one
who can see the Hollows.

849
01:16:15,038 --> 01:16:18,335
Yeah, I see them sure
but, I'm not my grandpa.

850
01:16:18,346 --> 01:16:19,608
I'm not and I...I

851
01:16:20,345 --> 01:16:22,747
can't fight, I can't kill somebody...

852
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:30,484
There's only one reason
that I'd stay here.

853
01:16:30,495 --> 01:16:32,305
Please!... just go.

854
01:17:01,218 --> 01:17:04,336
Jake... Jake, here you are!
Thank God!

855
01:17:04,347 --> 01:17:07,704
When I heard they found
a body, I freaked.

856
01:17:32,074 --> 01:17:36,207
- Are there stray dogs around here?
- What are you talking about?

857
01:17:36,217 --> 01:17:37,544
Its like,

858
01:17:37,555 --> 01:17:42,852
when they find an injured animal,
they go for the soft parts first.

859
01:17:42,862 --> 01:17:45,833
Same thing happened
to my father.

860
01:17:45,844 --> 01:17:48,377
The police are on their way.

861
01:17:49,838 --> 01:17:51,038
Dad, I gotta go?

862
01:17:51,049 --> 01:17:52,619
No... you don't Jake.

863
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:55,011
If this wasn't an accident...

864
01:17:55,012 --> 01:17:57,077
there's a lunatic on the island.

865
01:17:57,088 --> 01:18:01,787
I've known everyone on this island,
my whole life except you and him...

866
01:18:01,788 --> 01:18:03,899
And he's been in the
pub all afternoon.

867
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:05,430
So have I... I was sleeping.

868
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:07,691
What about the blind fellow?
I mean...

869
01:18:07,702 --> 01:18:11,080
I assumed he was blind.
The gentleman with the dark glasses.

870
01:18:11,091 --> 01:18:12,907
Arrived on the same ferry as me.

871
01:18:12,917 --> 01:18:20,323
- I kept seeing him around.
- Jake! Jake!

872
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:33,414
- Is your son alright?
- No, he has mental health issues.

873
01:18:33,954 --> 01:18:37,357
- I can't...
- Let me, I run 5 K's all the time.

874
01:18:50,878 --> 01:18:52,149
Hello!

875
01:18:56,622 --> 01:19:00,151
Hello! Is that you, young man?

876
01:19:00,162 --> 01:19:04,632
You came through?...
You're a peculiar?

877
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:10,260
Oh yes, and I'm extremely
grateful to you.

878
01:19:10,271 --> 01:19:14,490
It's terribly hard... to
find loops these days.

879
01:19:15,728 --> 01:19:19,372
So you followed me from
the beach on purpose?

880
01:19:19,383 --> 01:19:23,738
Oh no. I've been following
you much further than that!

881
01:19:29,149 --> 01:19:30,452
Dr. Golan?!

882
01:19:30,463 --> 01:19:35,663
Sometimes when it suits me...
the breadth of

883
01:19:35,664 --> 01:19:41,428
my peculiarity is purely
limited by my imagination ..

884
01:19:41,439 --> 01:19:43,879
The only thing I can't change...

885
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:48,684
is my eyes.

886
01:19:54,730 --> 01:19:57,267
Mr. Barron, How do you do?

887
01:19:58,978 --> 01:20:05,340
I saw you, at your grandfather's.
I was hoping to get.

888
01:20:05,419 --> 01:20:09,293
Ms. Peregrine's address
from him, but alas...

889
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:13,429
my traveling companion got
to him before I did...

890
01:20:15,036 --> 01:20:19,258
and as you know, there's no
stopping a hungry Hollowgasts.

891
01:20:19,269 --> 01:20:24,946
Speaking of my traveling companion...
he's coming.

892
01:20:25,955 --> 01:20:28,282
And believe me when I say to you

893
01:20:28,293 --> 01:20:33,374
you don't want to be here.
When he arrives.

894
01:20:33,385 --> 01:20:40,475
So, lets be on your way...
shall we?

895
01:20:57,511 --> 01:20:58,778
I mustn't forget our calendar.

896
01:20:58,789 --> 01:21:01,194
Could you fetch it from the
parlor please, Miss Avocet?

897
01:21:05,187 --> 01:21:06,698
Go and help the others.

898
01:21:20,119 --> 01:21:25,322
Miss. Peregrinee what a
pleasure to meet you, at last!

899
01:21:25,333 --> 01:21:26,845
May we come in?

900
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:37,677
Children, would you make your
way down the stairs please?

901
01:21:37,688 --> 01:21:40,785
I give the orders in
this house, Mr. Baron!

902
01:21:40,786 --> 01:21:42,049
Not today.

903
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:45,560
You should know that Jake
has served his purpose.

904
01:21:45,571 --> 01:21:47,100
If you value his life

905
01:21:47,101 --> 01:21:51,305
I suggest everyone does as
they are told! Children!

906
01:21:53,346 --> 01:21:57,275
Shush! No one tells my
children what to do.

907
01:21:57,286 --> 01:22:00,232
Children come down here, please.

908
01:22:04,335 --> 01:22:07,108
Ms. Peregrine...
I thought I told you to be quiet!

909
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:16,025
Children, for jake's safety, we are
going to do what Mr. Barron asks.

910
01:22:16,026 --> 01:22:18,924
He wishes to take me with him
to his rendezvous in Blackpool.

911
01:22:18,935 --> 01:22:22,531
So for his protection, he would
like me to assume bird-form,

912
01:22:22,542 --> 01:22:24,491
preferably caged...

913
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:28,052
And he'd like you to make your way into
a lockable room, such as the parlor.

914
01:22:28,063 --> 01:22:29,102
As he wont release Jake

915
01:22:29,113 --> 01:22:32,592
if he fears an attack could be mounted
upon him once he loses his leverage.

916
01:22:33,849 --> 01:22:35,637
Correct, Mr. Barron?

917
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:40,734
You are sacrificing yourself
and all of us... for Jake?

918
01:22:40,735 --> 01:22:44,111
Mr. Barron travels
with a Hollow, Enoch.

919
01:22:44,122 --> 01:22:47,250
Once it arrives here,
we're all dead.

920
01:22:48,381 --> 01:22:50,911
Enoch, only Jake can see them.

921
01:22:50,922 --> 01:22:53,535
She means he's our only hope.

922
01:23:37,832 --> 01:23:43,209
It's been my privilege,
to care for you all.

923
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:45,848
Goodbye! My children.

924
01:23:56,206 --> 01:23:57,908
Now, let him go.

925
01:24:20,176 --> 01:24:24,036
Promise me one thing, Jake.

926
01:24:24,047 --> 01:24:30,270
That you will try to
look after them all.

927
01:24:30,281 --> 01:24:32,206
I Promise.

928
01:25:09,566 --> 01:25:12,511
Its getting dark. You won't even
be able to see their shadows.

929
01:25:12,522 --> 01:25:15,410
We have to stay inside. Its the
only place we stand a chance.

930
01:25:15,411 --> 01:25:16,787
He's quite right.

931
01:25:16,798 --> 01:25:20,765
Now where does Miss.
Peregrine keep her weapon?

932
01:25:21,126 --> 01:25:22,689
Now... all right children.

933
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:25,648
Make sure all the doors are locked
and the windows are latched.

934
01:25:25,659 --> 01:25:28,622
Everything must be sealed up tight.
Now quickly, quickly go.

935
01:25:44,435 --> 01:25:48,268
Jake, I think tonight
you better answer that.

936
01:25:53,312 --> 01:25:57,225
Hello?

937
01:25:59,857 --> 01:26:02,944
You... you don't know me.
I'm Jake.

938
01:26:02,955 --> 01:26:07,402
Ah! You're new. Well,
welcome to the family Jake.

939
01:26:07,403 --> 01:26:08,781
Now I can't talk long,

940
01:26:08,792 --> 01:26:12,988
so just tell Miss Peregrine that
I'm at the airbase, and I'm fine.

941
01:26:15,450 --> 01:26:19,030
I just wanted to say
that, I miss you

942
01:26:19,041 --> 01:26:22,904
and if I disappointed
you, I'm sorry...

943
01:26:22,915 --> 01:26:26,776
and you're the best
grandpa in the world.

944
01:26:52,050 --> 01:26:53,521
- Fiona!
- Got it!

945
01:26:54,522 --> 01:26:59,896
Miss. Avocet! Now children, now that
you are all here, there's a few rules.

946
01:26:59,906 --> 01:27:03,777
Your primary job is to stay safe.
Leave the Hollow to me.

947
01:27:03,788 --> 01:27:05,980
I don't want to see any heroics.

948
01:27:05,981 --> 01:27:10,855
Now, those of you with garden tools,
I must insist that you...

949
01:27:34,134 --> 01:27:35,665
No Enoch! Get back!

950
01:28:01,817 --> 01:28:03,748
Go! Get to the attic.

951
01:28:06,861 --> 01:28:07,922
Take her!

952
01:28:22,253 --> 01:28:25,756
Go! Go! Get out! All Come on.

953
01:28:42,790 --> 01:28:46,563
Alright... crap! Its almost reset.

954
01:28:50,806 --> 01:28:54,009
Fiona, is there anything you can do
with that tree?

955
01:28:54,109 --> 01:28:55,140
Be careful!

956
01:28:58,753 --> 01:29:01,055
We're going through the windows.
Lets go!

957
01:29:25,695 --> 01:29:26,766
Come on!

958
01:29:37,154 --> 01:29:38,525
Claire! Come on down.

959
01:30:12,453 --> 01:30:13,824
Go Fiona!

960
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:22,671
Let's move on!

961
01:30:46,511 --> 01:30:51,185
- What was that?
- The loop closing. It is gone.

962
01:31:12,362 --> 01:31:15,689
I'm sorry Jake?
What do we do now?

963
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:18,636
Is there any sign of Barron...

964
01:31:18,637 --> 01:31:24,011
- and Miss. Peregrinee?
- Gone. Barron must have had a boat.

965
01:31:27,724 --> 01:31:31,421
Well, we have to go after them.
We know he is taking her to Blackpool.

966
01:31:31,432 --> 01:31:33,868
But Blackpool is miles
away, and the next ferry

967
01:31:33,869 --> 01:31:37,341
doesn't go for hours..
We'll never make it in time.

968
01:31:37,342 --> 01:31:40,204
Not unless we go by boat too!

969
01:33:26,101 --> 01:33:30,444
So there's a loop here in Blackpool,
its only six months old.

970
01:33:30,455 --> 01:33:33,546
January 11th, 2016.
With Miss. Avocet gone...

971
01:33:33,547 --> 01:33:37,415
- It can't be reset.
- Won't the loop closes?

972
01:33:37,426 --> 01:33:40,202
Then its back to real time.

973
01:33:40,833 --> 01:33:43,905
Jake, you know what
this means, don't you?

974
01:33:43,916 --> 01:33:45,405
You're going to die.

975
01:33:45,406 --> 01:33:47,098
Thats not what I mean.

976
01:33:47,109 --> 01:33:50,769
We have to get to our own time.
But you don't.

977
01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:53,426
You can continue
to live in 2016.

978
01:33:54,254 --> 01:33:55,795
But why would I do that?

979
01:33:55,806 --> 01:34:00,157
If we kill Barron,
he'll be gone but time will carry on.

980
01:34:00,168 --> 01:34:02,663
He won't go to Florida,

981
01:34:02,674 --> 01:34:06,577
Abe won't die and
you can go home.

982
01:34:09,446 --> 01:34:11,187
I can see my grandpa.

983
01:34:16,292 --> 01:34:18,250
Listen! I can explain
everything to them.

984
01:34:18,261 --> 01:34:20,405
I can persuade them to
take me to the island.

985
01:34:22,006 --> 01:34:27,811
Will you still there?
Our old loop's gone... for good.

986
01:34:28,882 --> 01:34:31,650
We wouldn't see
each other again.

987
01:34:31,661 --> 01:34:34,266
I thought you wanted me to stay

988
01:34:37,569 --> 01:34:43,103
I know you'll choose Abe.
If I minded I wouldn't have told you.

989
01:34:52,091 --> 01:34:55,633
So, we found Miss. Avocet's
loop on the map yet?

990
01:34:55,644 --> 01:34:59,536
Its here, but its new, she
made it earlier this year.

991
01:34:59,537 --> 01:35:00,459
Its my year.

992
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:04,149
If we don't get out before it closes,
we're stuck in January 2016.

993
01:35:04,151 --> 01:35:08,623
Great! So time catches up with all of us,
we all die except you!

994
01:35:08,624 --> 01:35:10,272
Plan? Loop closes at 4:30.

995
01:35:10,283 --> 01:35:14,328
I mean, we need to get in, rescue
the Ymbrynes... and get out.

996
01:35:14,329 --> 01:35:15,696
If we're not dead already.

997
01:35:15,707 --> 01:35:19,903
Miss. Avocet said the machine is in the
cellar of the Blackpool tower building.

998
01:35:19,913 --> 01:35:22,585
That means we'll be
indoors with Hollows.

999
01:35:22,596 --> 01:35:26,729
No... we wont! I've got a plan,
but I'm going to need your help.

1000
01:35:57,574 --> 01:36:01,646
- This can't be it, can it?
- Loop entrances can be anywhere.

1001
01:36:01,647 --> 01:36:04,059
The one in london is in a subway tunnel.

1002
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:22,184
- Sure, this is it?
- I think so

1003
01:36:24,256 --> 01:36:27,849
Miller, there's something
I need you to do first.

1004
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:29,080
Alright, I know.

1005
01:36:32,242 --> 01:36:35,665
Look! There's the tower.
Its not far.

1006
01:36:35,676 --> 01:36:38,557
Easy for you say! I'm freezing.

1007
01:36:44,062 --> 01:36:45,433
Ready?

1008
01:36:56,522 --> 01:37:01,255
All the doors to the cellar are locked.
The only way to reach the Ymbrines is...

1009
01:37:01,256 --> 01:37:04,899
- Thats backstage.
- How many Hollows can you see?

1010
01:37:05,499 --> 01:37:08,121
Four. Its good news.

1011
01:37:08,132 --> 01:37:10,834
I think you and I have a very
different definition of good news.

1012
01:37:11,045 --> 01:37:13,914
It means Barron's other friends
haven't arrived yet...

1013
01:37:13,916 --> 01:37:19,490
Means they haven't started the experiment.
We're not too late.

1014
01:37:20,692 --> 01:37:24,317
Ok Emma, you ready?
You know what to say.

1015
01:37:24,328 --> 01:37:25,328
Hey, Jake.

1016
01:37:28,038 --> 01:37:31,374
Our brethren should be
joining us momentarily.

1017
01:37:31,385 --> 01:37:32,580
This is a day...

1018
01:37:32,581 --> 01:37:34,056
Hey! You down there.

1019
01:37:34,067 --> 01:37:36,976
We killed your Hollow
friend Mr. Barron

1020
01:37:36,987 --> 01:37:39,957
and now we've come for
Miss. Peregrinee.

1021
01:37:39,967 --> 01:37:43,245
Bring her and all the other
Ymbrines to the end of the pier

1022
01:37:43,258 --> 01:37:46,473
in five minutes... or
face the consequences.

1023
01:37:50,146 --> 01:37:53,837
These children must be as
insane as their headmistress

1024
01:37:53,848 --> 01:37:58,142
Still... the Hollows
will be glad of a feed.

1025
01:38:01,165 --> 01:38:02,765
Where are you?

1026
01:38:02,776 --> 01:38:06,287
I know you're in here somewhere.

1027
01:38:06,898 --> 01:38:10,967
Ah... good..., listen to me.

1028
01:38:10,978 --> 01:38:13,695
I want you to follow
Mr. Archer...

1029
01:38:13,725 --> 01:38:15,026
and Mr. Clark.

1030
01:38:15,037 --> 01:38:20,240
They are going to take you down to
the pier for a little afternoon tea.

1031
01:38:21,471 --> 01:38:22,907
Mr. Archer, Mr. Clark,

1032
01:38:22,918 --> 01:38:25,985
gather the Hollows and
take them to the pier.

1033
01:38:26,075 --> 01:38:27,366
Those children killed Malphus?

1034
01:38:27,377 --> 01:38:29,948
Barron has had it for Malphus
since he killed Abe Portman.


1035
01:38:29,958 --> 01:38:34,732
Thats Abe Portman for months.

1036
01:38:35,793 --> 01:38:37,463
All I needed was a few minutes

1037
01:38:37,474 --> 01:38:40,636
to get the location of Miss.
Peregrine's loop from him.

1038
01:38:40,637 --> 01:38:42,200
But no.

1039
01:38:42,211 --> 01:38:45,870
Malphus couldn't
wait and instead

1040
01:38:45,881 --> 01:38:48,452
I had to masquerade as

1041
01:38:48,453 --> 01:38:56,453
a psychiatrist for three weeks in Florida.
Have you ever been to Florida?

1042
01:39:01,974 --> 01:39:04,335
Did I not tell you to
gather the Hollows?

1043
01:39:04,346 --> 01:39:05,516
What if it's a trap?

1044
01:39:05,517 --> 01:39:08,409
Of course it is Miss. Edwards!
But what of it?

1045
01:39:08,420 --> 01:39:12,603
A couple of children against four Hollows.
Lets get this over with.

1046
01:39:31,869 --> 01:39:33,330
Jake, I'm atuck!

1047
01:39:39,675 --> 01:39:40,886
Hurry up!

1048
01:40:02,454 --> 01:40:03,655
They are coming!

1049
01:40:27,634 --> 01:40:29,466
Enoch now!

1050
01:40:48,241 --> 01:40:49,502
Go now!

1051
01:41:02,492 --> 01:41:04,134
Can be seen now.

1052
01:41:12,581 --> 01:41:13,652
Emma! Go!

1053
01:41:17,325 --> 01:41:19,456
Don't just stand there!
Get them!

1054
01:43:05,883 --> 01:43:08,645
Alright, good job guys.
Time for Step 2.

1055
01:43:08,656 --> 01:43:10,195
Save the Ms. Peregrine.

1056
01:43:10,196 --> 01:43:15,571
That's... sort of step 3.
First we've got to deal with Barron.

1057
01:43:18,073 --> 01:43:21,745
- They should've been back by now.
- I said it was a trap.

1058
01:43:21,746 --> 01:43:26,720
If thats true, perhaps we
should move the Ymbrynes now.

1059
01:43:27,531 --> 01:43:29,001
You are not serious?

1060
01:43:29,012 --> 01:43:33,264
Do I not look serious? Do I
not look like a man who has

1061
01:43:33,265 --> 01:43:38,979
trudged the globe looking for just one
more eye to eat in hopes of regaining ..

1062
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:42,487
sufficient humanity to
return to his research?

1063
01:43:42,498 --> 01:43:44,353
A man who spent years...

1064
01:43:44,354 --> 01:43:48,598
hunting Ymbrynes in
preparation for this night?

1065
01:43:48,609 --> 01:43:51,339
And 2...no..3 days in Wales ..

1066
01:43:51,340 --> 01:43:59,185
Pretending to look at birds.
I assure you I'll will not stand idly by.

1067
01:43:59,186 --> 01:44:02,889
To see my destiny derailed.

1068
01:44:09,365 --> 01:44:10,736
Hugh, do it now!

1069
01:44:25,067 --> 01:44:27,569
Come back here! Get them!

1070
01:44:35,516 --> 01:44:37,452
Low, get down!

1071
01:44:37,463 --> 01:44:42,430
You think you can
stand in my way?

1072
01:44:42,432 --> 01:44:44,032
You Jake,

1073
01:44:44,043 --> 01:44:50,442
content to age and die as if you had
not the gift of peculiarity, at all?

1074
01:44:55,752 --> 01:45:02,727
I am a higher being.
I hold a secret to eternal life.

1075
01:45:02,728 --> 01:45:05,641
- Sorry to interrupt.
- What the...?

1076
01:45:16,289 --> 01:45:17,790
Bronwyn.

1077
01:45:24,136 --> 01:45:25,872
You missed me again, Jake.

1078
01:45:25,883 --> 01:45:28,819
I take it, accuracy is
not you peculiarity.

1079
01:45:40,439 --> 01:45:43,071
Abe was a much worthier adversary.

1080
01:45:46,174 --> 01:45:48,185
Don't let him get to the birds!

1081
01:45:59,634 --> 01:46:03,037
You must put me in contact
with your tailor.

1082
01:46:04,849 --> 01:46:09,022
Ymbrynes... Ymbrynes, here I come!

1083
01:46:20,942 --> 01:46:24,143
Cold. Wait till the blood
freezes in your veins.

1084
01:46:29,088 --> 01:46:31,731
That was your attempt to
rescue your friend? Was it?

1085
01:46:56,371 --> 01:46:58,571
Jake!
I'll hold him as long as I can

1086
01:46:58,572 --> 01:47:02,229
when are you going to realise you are
a terrible shot with that thing?

1087
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:04,186
Get the others,
I'll meet you at the.

1088
01:47:04,187 --> 01:47:05,688
Loop entrance.

1089
01:47:19,309 --> 01:47:20,510
He's getting out.

1090
01:47:49,264 --> 01:47:52,828
Eventually you're going
to run out of breath

1091
01:47:52,839 --> 01:47:56,573
and it'll all be over.

1092
01:47:56,584 --> 01:48:00,304
Death for your beloved Jake
and Miss Megan Peregrinee...

1093
01:48:00,315 --> 01:48:04,691
and everlasting life for me.

1094
01:49:02,864 --> 01:49:04,935
Olive! Olive!

1095
01:49:09,109 --> 01:49:10,867
I'm so sorry, Olive.

1096
01:49:10,878 --> 01:49:14,482
All these years I never
appreciated you.

1097
01:49:14,493 --> 01:49:17,829
I didn't see how lucky I was.

1098
01:49:19,968 --> 01:49:23,941
I got so used to having you
there, I never realized.

1099
01:49:31,587 --> 01:49:33,359
You never realised, what?

1100
01:50:22,779 --> 01:50:25,151
Find your children.
Create new loops.

1101
01:50:28,393 --> 01:50:29,882
So Jake,

1102
01:50:29,893 --> 01:50:33,533
I see you've inherited your
grandfather's peculiarity.

1103
01:50:33,544 --> 01:50:35,859
You're just as
annoying as he was.

1104
01:50:38,972 --> 01:50:44,026
Speaking of Abe, if you should
see him in the afterlife,

1105
01:50:44,037 --> 01:50:45,898
Give him my regards.

1106
01:50:54,074 --> 01:50:56,777
Please, we can't risk
him taking you again.

1107
01:51:15,842 --> 01:51:17,008
Enoch! Where are the others?

1108
01:51:17,019 --> 01:51:19,314
There safe. Olive is leading
them back to the ghost ship.

1109
01:51:19,315 --> 01:51:21,457
Jake needs us.
Barron's too strong.

1110
01:51:29,003 --> 01:51:32,205
You've lost Miss. Peregrine.
You've lost everything!

1111
01:51:32,216 --> 01:51:33,316
Its over!

1112
01:51:46,567 --> 01:51:48,238
Jake?

1113
01:51:51,841 --> 01:51:53,813
Jake?

1114
01:51:57,086 --> 01:51:58,787
Jake?

1115
01:52:05,062 --> 01:52:08,173
Emma? Wait, thats not me. It is Barron.

1116
01:52:08,175 --> 01:52:11,207
Don't listen to him. He is Barron.
I'm Jake. That's Barron.

1117
01:52:12,508 --> 01:52:15,950
Well I got better shot than Jake.
So neither of you move till we sort this.

1118
01:52:15,951 --> 01:52:17,236
Listen to me. I'm Jake.

1119
01:52:17,247 --> 01:52:20,253
I grew up in Florida and I
wanted to be an explorer.

1120
01:52:20,255 --> 01:52:23,096
I never thought nothing would ever
change because I was ordinary.

1121
01:52:23,097 --> 01:52:24,467
Thats Jake get Barron.

1122
01:52:24,478 --> 01:52:27,769
Wait! I told him all this.
She was my psychiatrist.

1123
01:52:27,771 --> 01:52:30,443
You deal with him.
I'll go find Miss. Peregrinee.

1124
01:52:38,489 --> 01:52:45,175
Wait. I can prove that I'm me,
because I am not ordinary

1125
01:52:48,077 --> 01:52:50,049
I can do something that no one else can

1126
01:52:58,466 --> 01:53:00,697
I can see the monsters.

1127
01:53:09,244 --> 01:53:12,257
Wait, it's me!

1128
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:29,081
Enoch!

1129
01:53:45,214 --> 01:53:48,096
We need to go.
The loop is closing.

1130
01:53:48,107 --> 01:53:49,227
Yeah.

1131
01:53:50,318 --> 01:53:52,059
Those of us who are leaving.

1132
01:54:57,583 --> 01:54:58,649
Emma...

1133
01:54:58,660 --> 01:55:01,915
You love your grandfather.
There's nothing more to explain.

1134
01:55:01,916 --> 01:55:05,098
No, I promised Miss Peregrine
that I'd look after you all

1135
01:55:05,109 --> 01:55:08,322
and with her injured and
you without a loop...

1136
01:55:08,333 --> 01:55:13,209
She'll recover and until
then we'll be in 1943.

1137
01:55:13,220 --> 01:55:18,548
We'll only age one day at a time.
Like normal people,

1138
01:55:18,550 --> 01:55:22,552
- Which can be no bad thing.
- And what about the Hollows?

1139
01:55:22,553 --> 01:55:26,695
As long as they are out
there, you are not safe.

1140
01:55:26,696 --> 01:55:29,646
We don't need you to
make us feel safe, Jake.

1141
01:55:29,657 --> 01:55:34,082
Because you made us feel brave.
And thats even better.

1142
01:56:36,723 --> 01:56:38,695
Cmon guys, lets go!

1143
01:57:22,271 --> 01:57:30,271
And then we said goodbye and loop closed.
I was so scared that you wouldn't be here.

1144
01:57:33,229 --> 01:57:37,333
I'd never see you again.
I am safe.

1145
01:57:40,946 --> 01:57:48,052
Let me give you your birthday present.
Grandpa, my birthday isn't for months.

1146
01:57:51,725 --> 01:57:55,315
For your travels. Go to her.
Jake.

1147
01:57:55,326 --> 01:57:59,735
You have the map.
You can go back to 1943.

1148
01:58:05,456 --> 01:58:09,589
Even so, they took a boat.
I don't know where they are.

1149
01:58:11,831 --> 01:58:14,563
But you know where they were.

1150
01:58:53,105 --> 01:58:56,808
You have no idea how long
it took me to get here.

1151
01:58:59,350 --> 01:59:02,022
The closest loop was in
the California desert.

1152
01:59:10,168 --> 01:59:12,811
I used it to get
to the Tokyo loop.

1153
01:59:16,914 --> 01:59:20,202
That led me to the nearest
loop back in 1942,

1154
01:59:20,213 --> 01:59:23,499
where I wound up joining the navy.
Don't ask.

1155
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:26,802
Then I spent 2 months in London trying...

1156
01:59:53,544 --> 01:59:56,255
Ready. Full speed ahead!
